NAME
    Log::Any::For::DBI - Add logging to DBI method calls, etc

VERSION
    version 0.03

SYNOPSIS
     use DBI;
     use Log::Any::For::DBI;

     # now all connect()'s, do()'s, prepare()'s are logged with Log::Any
     my $dbh = DBI->connect("dbi:...", $user, $pass);
     $dbh->do("INSERT INTO table VALUES (...)");

SEE ALSO
    Log::Any::For::Class

    DBIx::Log4perl, one of the inspirations for this module. With due
    respect to its author, I didn't like the approach of DBIx::Log4perl and
    its intricate links to DBI's internals. I'm sure DBIx::Log4perl is good
    at what it does, but currently I only need to log SQL statements.
